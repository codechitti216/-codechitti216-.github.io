        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are tools used for security purposes
        to monitor and analyze network traffic and system activity. Their main
        goal is to detect any potential malicious activities or policy
        violations in real time. With the continuous expansion of computer
        networks, concerns regarding vulnerability and security have become more
        significant. This has led to the need for effective intrusion detection
        systems (IDS). However, commercially available IDS often struggle with
        identifying new types of attacks and may generate false alarms for
        legitimate user activities. To address these challenges and improve
        accuracy, we propose a unique approach that combines correlation-based
        feature selection (CFS) with neural networks for anomaly detection in
        IDS. To validate our approach, we conducted experimental analysis using
        benchmark datasets specifically designed for intrusion detection; NSL
        KDD and UNSW NB. These datasets cover various attack scenarios. Our
        results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms several
        state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and
        specificity. By leveraging neural networks along with correlation-based
        attribute selection, we achieve higher accuracy in identifying anomalies
        while distinguishing them from legitimate user activities. Moreover, our
        research highlights the potential application of such IDS models in
        securing Internet of Things (IoT) servers in the future. This would help
        in creating strong security measures for wireless payment systems and
        allow for secure management of interconnected networks, resulting in
        smooth operations without errors and enhanced performance. In
        conclusion, our study showcases the efficacy of integrating
        correlation-based feature selection with neural networks for enhancing
        anomaly detection in intrusion detection systems. The proposed model
        exhibits superior performance compared to existing techniques, offering
        promising prospects for securing computer networks and IoT
        infrastructures in the face of evolving threats.
