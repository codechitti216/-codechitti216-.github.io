        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This project focuses on employing computer vision and image processing
          techniques to detect and classify drones from video feeds or images.
          Utilizing deep learning models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and
          OpenCV, the goal was to accurately identify drones in various
          environments.
        </p>

      <section id="approach">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
          The project involved data collection, model training using annotated
          datasets, and implementation of computer vision algorithms.
          Preprocessing steps like frame extraction, feature engineering, and
          model fine-tuning were performed to achieve optimal drone detection
          accuracy.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          The project yielded promising results in drone detection accuracy. The
          trained model successfully identified and localized drones in diverse
          settings, laying the groundwork for enhanced surveillance and security
          applications leveraging computer vision technology.
