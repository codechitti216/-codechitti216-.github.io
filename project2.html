        <h2>Abstract of the Project</h2>
        The Indian markets economic sector is characterized by the nation's
        growth in various sectors during the 1990s. This growth generated a huge
        demand for trained labor in the job markets, which in turn made
        engineering one of the top study choices over the years after high
        school. Compensation planning is another major strategic zone for the
        growth and performance of companies in the IT industry, where awareness
        is a key factor for a business. Many companies and corporations consider
        employee turnover to be a major issue. The issue is important because it
        affects not only the profitability of work but also the continuity of
        planning and culture of enterprises. The purpose of this paper is to
        predict the salary based on skills known to the worker and the work
        experience he has done in that area. An optimum salary is necessary to
        get productive output workers. Finding our salary figures that can
        provide a reasonable understanding of the CTC salary when deciding
        during interviews with the HR manager and this salary figure, based on
        different current skills details

        <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
        The problem is to develop a machine learning model that accurately
        predicts the salaries of engineering students right after they graduate
        from college. This prediction will help students make informed decisions
        about their career paths, assist educational institutions in aligning
        their curriculum with industry demands, and facilitate fair salary
        negotiations. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and relevant
        features, we aim to build a robust model that can provide accurate
        salary estimates based on students' profiles, such as their educational
        background, specialization, internships, academic performance, and other
        relevant factors.

        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Availability of limited or incomplete data</li>
          <li>
            The complexity and variability of the factors that influence
            engineering salaries. Various factors, such as industry sector,
            geographic location, job role, company size, and market conditions,
            can significantly impact salary outcomes
          </li>
          <li>
            The model's generalizability to new and unseen data is a challenge.
            Engineering salaries can be influenced by external factors such as
            economic conditions, industry trends, and technological
            advancements. These factors may change over time, and the model
            needs to be robust enough to adapt and provide accurate predictions
            in dynamic environments.

        <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
        Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline
        that involves transforming raw data into a clean and organized format
        suitable for analysis. It typically includes tasks like handling missing
        values, handling outliers, scaling features, and addressing data
        inconsistencies to ensure data quality and reliability.

        <h2>What is Correlation?</h2>
        What is Correlation? Correlation is a statistical measure used to
        evaluate the relationship between two variables. It provides insights
        into how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another
        variable. The correlation coefficient, ranging from -1 to +1, quantifies
        the strength and direction of this relationship. A positive correlation
        indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to
        increase as well. Conversely, a negative correlation suggests that as
        one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. A
        correlation coefficient close to 0 implies a weak or no relationship
        between the variables. It's important to note that correlation does not
        imply Correlation Matrix Analysis causation, as it solely captures
        statistical association. Scatter plots are commonly used to visualize
        correlations. Understanding correlations is crucial in fields such as
        finance, economics, social sciences, and data analysis, as it aids in
        identifying patterns, making predictions, and informing decision-making
        processes.

        <h3>Analysis of Variable Salary</h3>
        The Salary Distribution graph is a histogram represents the frequency or
        count of different salary values, giving an overview of how salaries are
        distributed across the dataset. The Salary Curve Distribution graph
        represents the salary values sorted in ascending order. The x-axis
        represents the indices of the data points in the DataFrame, while the
        y-axis represents the corresponding salary values.

      <section id="Machine Learning Models Used">
        <div>
          <h3>Decision Trees</h3>
          <p>
            Decision trees are versatile and interpretable machine learning
            models that can be used for both classification and regression
            tasks. They mimic human decision-making processes by recursively
            partitioning the data based on features to make predictions or
            decisions.
          </p>

          <h3>Linear Regression</h3>
          <p>
            Linear regression is a popular and widely used statistical model for
            typical regression problems.
          </p>

          <h3>Random Forest</h3>
          <p>
            Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple
            decision trees to make predictions. It is a versatile and powerful
            algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression
            tasks.
